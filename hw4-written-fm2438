2 ^ 32 / 8192 = 524,288 entries
524,288 * 100 ns / 100 ms * 100% = 52.4%

(a)
Much of the unused virtual addresses will not be paged in the table to save	space.
(b)
16384 = 2 ^ 14, offset has 14 bits
2 ^ 38 / 2 ^ 14 = 2 ^ 24 entries
2 ^ 14 / 4 = 2 ^ 12 entries per page
2 ^ 24 / 2 ^ 12 = 2 ^ 12 pages
12 bits for the top level and 12 bits for the next level.

rate * 1 + (1 - rate) * 5 = 2    ==>    5 - rate * 4 = 2    ==>    rate = 75%

(a)
When using standard replacement algorithms, the earliest page visited will
always be evicted if the allocated pages are less than the sequence length,
thus when the evicted pages are later called in the sequence they were evicted,
there would be no future hits except for the possibility that the random page
reference may hit.
(b)
If pages are randomly evicted, then in theory there would only be 12 misses in
each sequence of 513 references. NRU degenerates to this situation if the R bit
is cleaned frequently compared with the length of each reference sequence. Or if
the most recently used pages are evicted, the expectation would be the same.

(a) NRU: Page 2
(b) FIFO: Page 3
(c) LRU: Page 1
(d) Second change: Page 2

7.
Gragment B causes less page faults. A page fault would be caused once for every
two rows, hence a total of 32 page faults. Fragment A causes a page fault for
every two elements, hence 2048 page faults.

8.
Three page faults: one for TLB miss, one for the page table page fault, and one for the actual
data page fault.
