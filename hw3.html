    <p>The written problems are to be done individually. The programming
    problems are to be done in your assigned groups. All homework submissions are to be made
    via <a href="http://courseworks.columbia.edu">Courseworks</a>. Refer
    to <a href="../policies.html#programming">the homework policy
    section</a> on the class web site for further details. </p>

    <h3> Written Assignment (40 pts) </h3>

<P> Exercise numbers refer to the course textbook, Modern Operating
  Systems(3rd edition).  Each problem is worth 5 points.  Make your
  answers concise. You'll lose points for verbosity. </P>

<OL>

  <li>MOS 2.13 (assume uniprocessor and disk with unlimited bandwidth) <p></p>In this problem your are to compare reading a file using a single-threaded file server and a multithreaded server. It takes 15 msec to get a request for work, dispatch it, and do the rest of the necessary processing, assuming that the data needed are in the block cache. If a disk operation is needed, as is the case one-third of the time, and additional 75msec is required, during which time the thread sleeps. How many requests/sec can the server handle if it is single threaded? If it is multithreaded?<p/></li>

  <LI>MOS 2.26 <p></p>Show how counting semaphores(i.e., semaphores that can hold an arbitrary value) can be implemented using only binary semaphores and ordinary machine instructions.<p/></LI>

  <LI>MOS 2.29 <p></p>Synchronization within monitors uses condition variables and two special operations <tt>wait</tt> and <tt>signal</tt>. A more general form of synchronization would be to have a single primitive <tt>waituntil</tt>, that had an arbitrary Boolean predicate as parameter. Thus one could say, for example,<p/><tt>waituntil x&lt;0 or y+z&lt;n</tt>  <p></p>
  The <tt>signal</tt> primitive would no longer be needed. This scheme is clearly more general then that of Hoare or Brinch Hansen, but it is not uses. Why not? Hint: Think about the implementation.<p/></LI>

  <LI>MOS 2.46 (use figure 2-46 instead of 2-20) <p></p>
  Consider the procedure <tt>put_forks</tt> in Fig. 2-46. Suppose that the variable <tt>state[i]</tt> was set to THINKING after the two calls to <tt>test</tt>, rather than <tt>before</tt>. How would this change affect the solution?</p></LI>

  <LI>MOS 2.50 <p></p>
  Solve the dining philosophers problem using monitors instead of semaphores.</p></LI>

  <LI>MOS 2.51 <p></p>
  Suppose that a university wants to show off how politically correct it is by applying the U.S. Supreme Court's "Separate but equal is inherently unequal" doctrine in gender as well as race, ending its long-standing practice of gender-segregated bathrooms on campus. However, as a concession to tradition, it decrees that when a woman is in a bathroom, other women may enter, but no men, and vice versa. A sign with a sliding marker on the door of each bathroom indicates which of three possible states it is currently in: <tt>Empty</tt>, <tt>Women present</tt>, <tt>Men present</tt>. In some programming language you like, write the following procedures <tt>woman_wants_to_enter, man_wants_to_enter, woman_leaves, man_leaves.</tt> You may use whatever counters and synchronization techniques you like.</p></LI>

  <LI> <p> Draw a thread schedule with two threads to show the error in
      the following software-based lock implementation.</p>
    <pre>
      int flag[2] = {0, 0}; // lock flags, one for each thread.  
                            // 1 indicates a thread wants to enter 
                            // the critical region; 0 indicates it doesn't

      lock()
      {
          flag[self] = 1;        // self is the current thread's ID.
          while(flag[1-self]==1) // 1-self is the other thread's ID
              ;
      }

      unlock()
      {
          flag[self] = 0;
      }
    </pre><p></p>
	</LI>

  <LI> Will Eraser report a race on the following code?  Why or why
    not?  Read about "bitfield" in 'K&R' if you don't know what it is.
<pre>
        struct {
            lock l1;
            lock l2;
            int f1:1; // bitfield, uses only 1 bit

    <h3> Group Programming Assignment (60 pts) </h3>

    <p> This programming assignment has two parts.  In Part A, you'll
      extend a simple user space threading library to support semaphores; in Part B, 
      you'll implement a readers-writer lock in the linux kernel that favors writers.
      For part A, we will provide you the files that you can get started with
      (see below). For part B, you will use the same development environment as 
      you did in HW2 by setting up your environment by following the instructions 
      <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/13fa-w4118/hw/kernel.html">
      here</a>. Make sure you start with a new kernel without your changes from 
      HW2.</p>

    <P>For the user threads package part of this assignment, be sure to Submit a 
	Makefile and a README file with your code. The Makefile should have at least a 
	default target that builds all assigned programs. The README should explain the 
	details of your solution, describe any way in which your solution differs from 
	what was assigned, and state any assumptions you made (5 pts). Also, use the 
	<KBD>-Wall</KBD> option to gcc when compiling. You will lose points if 
	<I>your</I> code produces warnings when compiled.</P>

	<p> For the kernel part, commit your source code changes using the 
        <tt>git add</tt> and <tt>git commit</tt> commands you learned from the 
        previous assignment. Remember to add your new file to the code repository.
        Then use the <tt>git diff</tt> command to get the code change. You should
        compare with the original version, so please do</p>
        <pre>    git diff 365a6e06</pre>

 <p>Here <tt>365a6e06</tt> refers to the initial version of the kernel
 source before you make any modifications.  Then submit the code
 difference in a .patch file. The file name should be hw3-group&lt;your
 group&gt;-code.patch.</p>

    <h4> Part A: Synchronization and threads in userspace (25 pts) </h4>

    <P>In this problem you will add synchronization functionality to the 
  implementation of <EM>SThreads</EM>, a simple threading library. Get the 
  source files found in <A 
  href=sthread>this 
  directory</A>. The files provide the source, header, and Makefile for the 
  SThreads library. The publicly available functions and datatypes are in the file 
  <CODE>sthread.h</CODE>. The library is used as follows: </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>
    <P>Threads are manipulated using variables of type <CODE>sthread_t</CODE>. 
    Consider <CODE>sthread_t</CODE> to be an opaque data type (i.e. only 
    functions in <CODE>sthread.c</CODE> get to know what it really is). </P>
    <LI>
    <P><CODE>sthread_init()</CODE> must be called exactly once, as the first 
    thing in <CODE>main()</CODE>. It returns 0 normally, and -1 on error. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>A new thread is created using the function: </P>
    <P><CODE>int sthread_create(sthread_t *t, sthread_main_t main, void 
    *arg)</CODE>. </P>
    <P>The first argument is where the <CODE>sthread_t</CODE> object is 
    returned. The second is the function the new thread should run. The third 
    argument is passed to this function. <CODE>sthread_create()</CODE> returns 0 
    normally and -1 on error. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>You are also provided with <CODE>sthread_self()</CODE>, which returns the 
    <CODE>sthread_t</CODE> associated with the currently running thread, as well 
    as <CODE>sthread_suspend()</CODE>, which puts the currently running thread 
    to sleep, and <CODE>sthread_wake(sthread_t t)</CODE>, which wakes up a 
    thread, given the thread's <CODE>sthread_t</CODE> object. Note that for the 
    SThreads library, first waking up a running thread and then suspending it 
    leaves the thread in a running state. </P>
    <LI>
    <P>Usage example: </P>
    <TABLE border=1>
      <TBODY>

threadmain(void *arg)

    printf("thread %d: I'm going to sleep\n", threadno);
    sthread_suspend();

</PRE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></LI></UL>
  <P>Note the <CODE>#define&nbsp;_REENTRANT</CODE> at the top of the file. This 
  is necessary in any multithreaded program, as it tells subsequent include 
  files to use reentrant versions of library functions and thread-safe 
  variables. For example, the <CODE>errno</CODE> variable, since it is a global 
  variable, is normally not thread-safe. A function in thread A can set it on 
  error, and thread B can set it to something else before the caller in thread A 
  ever gets to read the value. This is an example of a <EM>race condition</EM>. 
  If you <CODE>#define&nbsp;_REENTRANT</CODE>, though, <CODE>errno</CODE> is 
  redefined to <CODE>(*__errno_location())</CODE>, which references a different 
  address for each thread. An implementation of this function is provided in 
  <CODE>sthread.c</CODE>. </P>
  <P>You will also be provided with the function <CODE>test_and_set(int 
  *x)</CODE>, which atomically sets the integer that x points to to 1, and 
  returns its previous value. Using <CODE>sthread_suspend()</CODE>, 
  <CODE>sthread_wake()</CODE>, and <CODE>test_and_set()</CODE>, you are to 
  implement the missing semaphore primitives in the SThreads library. </P>
  <P>You may use <CODE>test_and_set()</CODE> to implement spinlocks, in which 
  you repeatedly call <CODE>test_and_set()</CODE> and a no-op in a tight loop, 
  waiting for the test result to be 0. <CODE>sched_yield()</CODE> is a good 
  no-op function to use, but you don't have to worry about precisely what it 
  does (not until the next homework, anyway!). Note that you can use spinlocks 
  to synchronize access on your semaphores' shared data structures, but not to 
  implement the semaphores themselves. In other words, if I call 
  <CODE>sthread_sem_down()</CODE> on an unavailable semaphore (the count of the semaphore is negative or 0), I should suspend 
  rather than spinning until the semaphore is available (the count of the semaphore is positive). </P>

  <div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1.</b> Understand the SThreads
    library. Run the usage example and understand why a particular
    sequence of output messages is generated by the execution.  </div>

  <P>Now comes the fun part. For this assignment, implement counting semaphores in the 
  SThreads library. Put your function implementations in a single file, called 
  <CODE>sync.c</CODE>, and your structure definitions in <CODE>sync.h</CODE>. 
  Skeleton files are provided, but you may have to add functions and datatypes 
  to these files. You shouldn't have to change <CODE>sthread.c</CODE> or 
  <CODE>sthread.h</CODE>. In fact, you shouldn't even have to look at the 
  implementations of the functions in <CODE>sthread.c</CODE> (but feel free if 
  you want to, of course). Unless otherwise noted, all functions should return 0 
  on success and -1 on error. </P>
  <P>The prototypes for the five functions you must implement are found in 
  <CODE>sync.h</CODE>, and are all named <CODE>sthread_sem_*</CODE>. You must 
  define <CODE>struct sthread_sem_struct</CODE>. 
  <CODE>sthread_sem_init(sthread_sem_t *sem, int count)</CODE> and <CODE>sthread_sem_destroy()</CODE> 
  should be used to initialize and free resources related to this struct. 
  The argument <CODE>int count</CODE> in <CODE>sthread_sem_init(sthread_sem_t *sem, int count)</CODE> indicates the count of the semaphore.
  The value of <CODE>int count</CODE> could be any positive number.</P>
  
  <P><CODE>sthread_sem_down()</CODE> will decrement the semaphore by 1 if the value of which is greater than 0 (these two steps must be atomic),
  	or it will block until another thread releases the semaphore and wakes it up. 
	<CODE>sthread_sem_up()</CODE> will increment the value of semaphore 
	by 1 if nobody is being blocked on it; if there are threads waiting for the semaphore, it should wake up one of the waiting
	threads; these two steps must also be atomic. <CODE>sthread_sem_try_down()</CODE> should obtain the semaphore and return 
  0 if the semaphore is available, otherwise return non-zero immediately. This 
  function does not cause the caller to block. </P>

  <div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2.</b> Implement semaphores in the
    SThreads library. </div>

  <P>Note that your implementation should not allow starvation of any
  thread waiting for the semaphore. That is, if two threads are repeatedly
  obtaining and releasing a semaphore, that should not prevent a third
  thread from eventually getting the semaphore. (Of course, if one thread
  never release the semaphore, the others will starve, but that's a
  programming error, i.e. not our problem!) </P>
  
  <div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 3.</b> Write a few testcases to test
  your semaphore implementation. </div>

  <P><STRONG>Part B: Synchronization in the Linux kernel (35 pts) </STRONG> </P>

  <P> Energy consumption is a critical issue when designing mobile applications.
  Data transfer over cellular radio networks is one of the most energy intensive 
  operations on mobile devices, and so cellular protocols such as 3G (HSPA) and
  LTE are designed to allow phones to keep their radio transmitters and receivers
  turned off when they are not needed. </P>

  <P> When the battery life of a mobile device is below a certain critical level,
  we might want to restrict which processes can access the network. If non-critical
  applications (e.g. social network updates) can be blocked from accessing the 
  network when power supply is limited, the mobile device can have a potentially
  longer operation span. This functionality can be achieved if every process
  that wishes to use the network needs to acquire a read lock, and a process
  that monitors the device battery life can obtain an exclusive lock if the battery
  life is below a critical level. When such a
  process acquires an exclusive lock, no other process can acquire a regular lock,
  which blocks subsequent process from accessing the network.</P>

  <P>For this problem, you will implement a regular-exclusive (reader-writer) "net-lock"
  kernel synchronization primitive that prioritizes exclusive lock holders over 
  regular lock holders. The locking primitive should be implemented in 
  <CODE>kernel/netlock.c</CODE> file, and should export the following system calls
  to acquire and release the net lock: </P>

  <pre>
     /* Syscall 378. Acquire netlock. <code>type</code> indicates
        whether a regular or exclusive lock is needed. Returns 0 on success 
	and -1 on failure.  
      */
     int netlock_acquire(netlock_t type);

     /* Syscall 379. Release netlock. Return 0 on success and -1 on failure.  
      */
     int netlock_release(void);

     enum __netlock_t {
        NET_LOCK_N, /* Placeholder for no lock */
	NET_LOCK_R, /* Indicates regular lock */
	NET_LOCK_E, /* Indicates exclusive lock */
     } ;
     typedef enum __netlock_t netlock_t;
  </pre>

  <P> The specification for this part is as follows. You may assume that all
  processes that intend to use the network must call <code>netlock_acquire</code>
  in regular (read) mode. The calls to acquire the lock in regular mode should
  succeed immediately as long as no process is holding an exclusive (write) lock
  or is waiting for an exclusive lock. Multiple processes may request the lock in 
  regular mode, and all of them should be granted the lock if this condition is
  met. If a process is currently holding or waiting for an exclusive lock, 
  subsequent calls to <code>netlock_acquire</code> in regular mode must block.
  All processes waiting for regular locks must be granted the lock once the 
  condition for granting the regular locks is fulfilled.</P>

  <P> Only one process may hold an exclusive lock at any given time.
  When a process requests an exclusive lock, it must wait until processes
  currently holding regular or exclusive locks release the locks using the 
  <code>netlock_release</code> system call. Processes requesting an exclusive
  lock get priority over processes waiting to get regular locks. If multiple
  processes request exclusive locks, they should be granted locks in the order
  of their request.</P>

  <p>Read LKD Ch. 4, pg 58-61 to learn about wait queues.  Read LKD Ch. 9
  and Ch. 10 to understand Linux synchronization methods.  Note that
  unlike the userspace semaphores you implemented for question 1, the
  synchronization primitives in Linux generally do not have owners and are
  not recursive. No owners means that there's nothing stopping any piece
  of code from unlocking every lock in the kernel (and bringing the kernel
  to a fiery screeching halt, probably). Not recursive means that the
  owner of a lock (even if there was such a thing) can't obtain the lock
  twice. </p>
    
  <div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 4.</b> Implement net-lock in
    Linux. For the purpose of this assignment, your implementation
    shouldn't use the Linux kernel's reader-writer spin-locks or
    reader-writer semaphores.</div>
    
<p> Note that your implementation must <b>favor writers over readers</b>:
  whenever there is a thread waiting to acquire the lock in write mode,
  you should let this thread acquire the lock as soon as possible, To
  illustrate this point, consider the following example.  Suppose the lock
  is held in read mode and a thread A is waiting to acquire the lock in
  write mode.  Another thread B comes, trying to acquire the lock in read
  mode.  In an implementation that favors readers over writers, thread B
  can immediately acquire the lock in read mode and proceed.  However, in
  your implementation, thread B must wait and thread A should grab the
  lock first. </p>

  <div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 5.</b> Write a few testcases to test
    your net-lock implementation. Your testcases should run in user-space
    (see the testcase of the last programming assignment).</div>
    
<p>Once the net-lock is implemented, we can modify the Linux kernel's
  network-related code to allow only processes holding the net-lock to
  send or receive packets.  We do not require you to implement this
  functionality because understanding and modifying network-related code
  is outside the scope of this assignment.  However, we welcome you to
  give it a try.  If you figure out how to implement this functionality,
  be sure to let us know by emailing your patch or design to the course
  staff mailing list. </p>
